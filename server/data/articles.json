Keep windows closed during high pollen days and use air purifiers with HEPA filters indoors. Change clothes and shower after spending time outside to remove pollen. Nasal irrigation with saline solution can flush out allergens, and over-the-counter antihistamines may provide relief. For persistent symptoms, consult with an allergist about immunotherapy options.",

    "content": "Regular exercise offers numerous health benefits beyond weight management. It reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Physical activity strengthens bones and muscles, improving mobility and reducing the risk of falls in older adults. Exercise releases endorphins, which can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. It also improves sleep quality and boosts energy levels. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity weekly, plus muscle-strengthening activities twice a week.",
